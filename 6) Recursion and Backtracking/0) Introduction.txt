1) Make input smaller
    => We are doing some decision, so input gets small automatically.
2) Recrusion - Decision space
    => We will have choices and we need to take decision to pick any choice
    => To take decision we need to identify this problem is regarding recursion or not
3) Recursive tree
    => If we design recursion tree than code will be very easy
4) 2 steps to solve any recursion
    => Design the recursive tree
    => Write the code

5) Approach to solve the recursion problem
    1) Recursion tree
    2) Hypothesis, Induction, Base condition
        1) Base condition => Smallest valid input from which we will stop recursive function call
        2) Induction => Recursive function call
        3) Hypothesis => Output the answer
    3) Choice
