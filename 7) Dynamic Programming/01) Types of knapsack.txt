If we learn how to solve 0-1 knapsack problem we can solve below knapsack related problems.

1) Subset sum
2) Equal sum partition
3) Count of subset sum
4) Minimum subset diff
5) Target sum 
6) Number of subset for given difference

Types of knapsack

1) 0-1 knapsack => Where we either add whole item to bag or not going to add the item
2) Fractional knapsack => Where we add fraction of the items(e.g. add 2kg of fraction from 10kg item)
3) Unbounded knapsack => Where we can add single item multiple times


Identification of knapsack problem
1) We have given items and maximum weight or maximum something else
